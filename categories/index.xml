      <title>1 Arizona State University</title>

      <description>I transferred to Arizona State University in Fall of 2015. I picked ASU over a couple schools that I had gotten into including UCSD and UCSC. ASU was certainly a huge change from SCC escpecially since I had moved here from California and it was the first time I had been away from my family. However, I did come here with my best friend from high school so that definitely made the process easier for me.</description>

      <title>2 Santiago Canyon College</title>

      <description>I went to Santiago Canyon College for 3 years after getting out of high school. Getting the classes I needed to transfer proved difficult given the volume of students that attended.
One of the major difficulties I had was getting into the programming and physics classes that were required to transer. There was only one professor at the time teaching C++ class required to transer, and his class filled up really quick.</description>

      <description>I went to Esperanza from Fall 2008 to Spring 2012. My first experience of high school was joining the football team, and meeting many new people.
School went pretty well, but was fairly challenging due to the amount of time that was required from football. Over time I realized the sport wasn&amp;rsquo;t for me. Not due to the challenge of the sport, but just didn&amp;rsquo;t really fit for me.
After my last season of football my sophomore year I joined the track team.</description>

      <description>A current ongoing project that has piqued my interest is Project Euler . Essentially it&amp;rsquo;s a series of math problems for which you need to devise an algorithm and a program to compute the solution.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it as a way to ramp up my skills in other languages that I am not comfortable with such as, Perl 6 , Clojure , and Ruby . I chose these languages for different reasons.</description>

      <description>Problem 1: If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000: Clojure  Perl 6  Ruby 
Problem 2: Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, &amp;hellip; By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms: Clojure  Perl 6  Ruby</description>

      <description>This website is my biggest personal project that I have undertaken.
It is hosted with Github Pages , which by far was the best option for my purpose. I wanted to have a website where I could showcase some projects that would show my skills and what tools and languages I am currently looking at.
As Github pages only hosts static sites I had to find the best tool to generate a static site that was presentable.</description>
